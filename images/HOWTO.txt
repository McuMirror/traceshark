INTRODUCTION

This document tries to describe how the icons have been created. The idea behind
the icons are functionalism and that they can be created quickly, without any
artistic talents whatsoever.

HOW?

1. Draw the image with the worlds best drawing program, xfig. Using it gives a
   nice 1980s style to the icons.

2. As a reference save the drawing in the native fig format.

3. In xfig, click File->Export

4. Select "Language", to PNG.

5. Export the file to a png file.

6. Open the png file in gimp, if you are asked convert it to sRGB.

7. In the gimp menu, select Layer->Transparency->Color to Alpha

8. The above should open a dialoge where you are allowed to convert a color to
   transparency, white should be the default, so you should only have to click
   OK.

9. Change the image to quadratic size, if it isn't already. This can happen by
   creating a new image of quadratic size and copying the image into it.

10. Save this intermediary result in gimp's native format, xcf, that is use
    "Save As" in the menu.

11. Scale the image to size 30x30. It happens with the menu "Image->Scale Image"
    You should select Interpolation to be "Sinc (Lanczos3)".

12. Save the scaled image as a png with "Export As". Add "30x30" to the base
    file name.
